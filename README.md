# CP-Wallet-Connector

This implementation provides a foundation for the CarPool Wallet Connect system. Here's what it does:

1. Connects to the user's Cardano wallet (currently set up for Nami wallet).
2. Fetches and displays delegation information.
3. Implements a discount tier system based on delegation amount and time.
4. Creates a custom user role for CarPool delegators.
5. Applies discounts in WooCommerce based on the user's discount tier.
6. Provides a framework for updating delegation information.


To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

1. Implement actual Cardano blockchain queries in the `cardano-api.php` file.
2. Set up a cron job or other mechanism to regularly update user delegation information.
3. Implement the actual delegation process in the `delegateToCarPool` function in the React component.
4. Add logic to verify token policies and attributes for special permissions.
5. Create the permissioned content pages and use the `carpool_check_user_permissions` function to restrict access.


Remember to thoroughly test this implementation, especially the blockchain interactions and financial calculations, to ensure everything works correctly and securely.


To use this wallet connector in your WordPress site:

1. Install and activate the plugin in your WordPress admin panel.
2. Add the shortcode `[cardano_wallet_connector]` wherever you want the wallet connector to appear on your site.
